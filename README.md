# Overview

This app is a TypeScript project to display weather forecast to the user. Utilizing the OpenWeatherAPI, it returns the forecast as a json object, parses it and displays the data to the console.

My purpose in writing this software was learning the ins-and-outs of APIs, json object and how to map that data. Initially, I intended to utilize this as the backend for an Android App, but discovered there are simpler methods of doing so for Android Development.
